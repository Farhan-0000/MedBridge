## 1. Project Purpose

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Hypertension patients seeking clinical guidance online face two categories of harm:

1. **Ungrounded medical advice** — generative AI models fabricate drug interactions, dosages, or recommendations not supported by authoritative clinical guidelines.
2. **Unsafe personalization** — systems provide patient-specific guidance without adequate medical context (e.g., recommending a beta-blocker without knowing the patient has asthma).

Standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems retrieve evidence but do not evaluate whether sufficient patient context or guideline evidence exists before generating a response. This creates a safety gap.

### 1.2 Project Definition

MedBridge is an **AI-assisted clinical communication system** for hypertension patients. It uses a **Two-Stage Answerability Engine** to evaluate both patient context sufficiency and retrieved evidence adequacy before generating any clinical guidance.

The system does **not** diagnose, prescribe, or replace a physician. It provides evidence-grounded informational guidance with citations to authoritative clinical guidelines, and deterministically refuses or escalates when safety conditions are not met.

### 1.3 Core Safety Differentiator

MedBridge introduces two sequential decision gates that standard RAG systems lack:

| Gate | Name | Position | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gate 1** | Context Gate | Pre-retrieval | Prevents personalized guidance when patient context is insufficient |
| **Gate 2** | Evidence Gate | Post-retrieval | Prevents generation when retrieved evidence is insufficient or query is dangerous |

These gates enforce **deterministic safety routing** into exactly one of five actions:

| Action | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| `SOFT-ASK` | Request missing patient context via a clarifying question (pre-retrieval short-circuit) |
| `ANSWER` | Deliver personalized, evidence-grounded clinical guidance with inline citations |
| `GENERALIZE` | Deliver unpersonalized general health information when specific evidence is insufficient |
| `ABSTAIN` | Safely refuse to answer when no relevant evidence exists or the query is out of domain |
| `ESCALATE` | Refer to a healthcare provider when the query indicates clinical danger or emergency |

> [!NOTE]
> **Conflict Resolved (ADL-008):** The High-Level Architecture diagram uses legacy terms ("Safe Answer", "Refusal", "Ask"). This document standardizes on the 5-action enum above. All implementation must use these canonical names exclusively.

### 4.2 Out of Scope

| Exclusion | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- |
| User authentication and authorization | Academic prototype; no login system |
| Multi-tenancy or role-based access control | Single-user sessions only |
| Real-time vital sign integration (EHR/FHIR) | No live clinical data feeds |
| Drug interaction databases (RxNorm live queries) | Offline guideline text only |
| Mobile native applications | Web browser only |
| PII anonymization enforcement | Acknowledged gap (ADL-017); deferred |
| Production-grade horizontal scaling | Single-node deployment for semester |
| Multilingual support | English only |

## 5. User Roles

| Role | Description | Capabilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hypertension Patient** | Primary end user. An adult diagnosed with or managing hypertension who seeks informational guidance about their condition, medications, lifestyle, or blood pressure readings. | Submit free-text clinical questions; receive grounded guidance with citations; view conversation history within a session. |
| **System Administrator** (implicit) | The developer or researcher deploying and maintaining the system. | Run ingestion pipeline; manage Docker containers; review audit logs; configure environment variables and API keys. |
| **Evaluator** (implicit) | A researcher running the MedBridge-AQ benchmark or adversarial tests. | Execute evaluation scripts against the API; compare routing accuracy across baselines. |

> [!NOTE]
> **Assumption (ASM-01):** No formal authentication exists. Sessions are identified by a `session_id` (UUID) created on first contact. Any user with the session URL can resume a session. This is acceptable for an academic prototype but would be a security defect in production.

## 6. Core Workflows

### 6.1 Primary Request Flow (PROCEED Path)

This is the full 8-stage pipeline when patient context is sufficient and the system proceeds to retrieval.

```

### 6.2 SOFT-ASK Short-Circuit (Insufficient Context)

When patient context is insufficient and `soft_ask_count < 2`:

```
Patient message → Context Extractor (LLM 1) → State Projector → Context Gate (LLM 2)
    → [INSUFFICIENT + count < 2]
    → Response Generator (LLM 4, SOFT-ASK template)
    → Increment soft_ask_count → Return clarifying question
```

### 6.3 Loop-Breaker Fallback (Context Still Insufficient After 2 Attempts)

When context remains insufficient but `soft_ask_count ≥ 2`:

```
Patient message → Context Extractor (LLM 1) → State Projector → Context Gate (LLM 2)
    → [INSUFFICIENT + count ≥ 2]
    → Force-route to GENERALIZE
    → Hybrid Retrieval → Reranking → Response Generator (LLM 4, general guidance)
    → Return unpersonalized guidance with MedlinePlus citations
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Conflict Resolved (ADL-013):** The sequence diagram omitted this branch entirely. This document adds it as a mandatory execution path. Without it, the system enters an infinite SOFT-ASK loop.

### 6.4 Emergency Fast-Path

When the input contains critical red-flag patterns:

```
Patient message → API Gateway → Emergency Triage Classifier (deterministic)
    → [EMERGENCY DETECTED]
    → Return pre-vetted ESCALATE template immediately
    → Bypass entire AI pipeline
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **New Component (ADL-002):** This fast-path does not exist in the original diagrams. This document adds it as a required component to avoid 3–6 second latency on life-threatening queries.

### 6.5 ABSTAIN / ESCALATE Deterministic Response

When the Evidence Gate routes to `ABSTAIN` or `ESCALATE`:

```
Evidence Gate → {action: ABSTAIN or ESCALATE}
    → Bypass LLM Call 4 (Response Generator)
    → Return pre-vetted template from application configuration
    → Write audit log
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Conflict Resolved (ADL-015):** The sequence diagram routes all actions through LLM Call 4. This document restricts LLM Call 4 to `ANSWER` and `GENERALIZE` only. `ABSTAIN` and `ESCALATE` use deterministic templates.

### 6.6 Offline Ingestion Pipeline

```
Clinical Guideline PDFs (AHA/ACC 2025, ESC/ESH 2024, MedlinePlus)
    → PyMuPDF text extraction
    → Section-aware chunking (with metadata preservation)
    → Dense embedding (bge-small-en-v1.5) + Sparse tokenization (fastembed BM25)
    → Upsert to Qdrant collection "clinical_guidelines"
    → Schema validation
```

### 7.1 Component Registry

| Layer | Component | Technology | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **L1 – Presentation** | Patient Chat UI | Streamlit (Python :8501) | Render chat interface, display responses with citations, manage session UX |
| **L2 – API** | FastAPI Backend | FastAPI / Uvicorn (Python :8000) | REST API gateway, session management, orchestrate AI pipeline, serve responses |
| **L2 – API** | Emergency Triage Classifier | Deterministic regex/rules | Pre-pipeline fast-path for emergency detection (ADL-002) |
| **L3 – AI Pipeline** | Context Extractor | LLM Call 1 (structured output) | Extract structured medical facts from raw patient message; produce delta events and reformulated search query |
| **L3 – AI Pipeline** | Deterministic State Projector | Python business logic | Apply typed delta events to the event log; fold event stream into context snapshot JSONB using deterministic rules (ADL-001) |
| **L3 – AI Pipeline** | Context Gate | LLM Call 2 (classification) | Binary classification: evaluate whether the accumulated context snapshot contains sufficient patient information for safe personalized retrieval |
| **L3 – AI Pipeline** | Hybrid Retriever | qdrant-client + fastembed | Execute parallel BM25 sparse + dense vector searches against Qdrant; fuse results via RRF; return Top-20 candidate chunks |
| **L3 – AI Pipeline** | Cross-Encoder Reranker | sentence-transformers | Rerank Top-20 candidates to Top-5 using pairwise query-document scoring |
| **L3 – AI Pipeline** | Evidence Gate | LLM Call 3 (classification) | Evaluate evidence sufficiency; route to ANSWER / GENERALIZE / ABSTAIN / ESCALATE |
| **L3 – AI Pipeline** | Response Generator | LLM Call 4 (constrained generation) | Synthesize patient-facing response with inline citations using XML-isolated prompt; only for ANSWER and GENERALIZE actions |
| **L3 – AI Pipeline** | Resilient LLM Wrapper | Python retry logic | Wrap all LLM calls with 3-attempt exponential backoff, JSON repair, and deterministic fallback on permanent failure (ADL-004) |
| **L4 – Storage** | PostgreSQL | Docker Container (:5432) | Append-only event log, context snapshots, sessions, audit logs |

| **L5 – Knowledge** | Clinical Guideline PDFs | Local filesystem | AHA/ACC 2025, ESC/ESH 2024, MedlinePlus source documents |
| **L5 – Knowledge** | Ingestion Worker | Python CLI script | One-time offline PDF parsing, chunking, embedding, and Qdrant indexing |
| **External** | LLM Inference API | Groq Cloud (Llama 3.1 8B) / OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini) | Remote LLM inference for all 4 pipeline calls via HTTPS REST |

> [!NOTE]
> **Conflict Resolved (ADL-007):** The deployment diagram labels the frontend as "React / Streamlit — Node.js Process (Port 3000)". Streamlit is a Python runtime on port 8501, not Node.js. This document standardizes on **Streamlit** as the semester frontend, as it aligns with the Python-only backend stack and removes the Node.js dependency.

> [!NOTE]
> **Conflict Resolved (ADL-023):** The original diagrams assign query reformulation to Context Gate (LLM Call 2). This document moves query reformulation to the Context Extractor (LLM Call 1), restricting Context Gate to pure binary classification only.

### 7.2 Component Interaction Matrix

| Producer → Consumer | Data Exchanged | Protocol |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Chat UI → FastAPI Backend | `{ message, session_id }` | HTTP REST / JSON |
| FastAPI Backend → PostgreSQL | SQL queries (event append, snapshot read/write, audit write) | SQL via SQLAlchemy (:5432) |

## 8. Data Entities

### 8.1 Session

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `session_id` | UUID (PK) | Unique identifier for a patient conversation session |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Session creation time |
| `last_active_at` | TIMESTAMP | Last message timestamp |

### 8.2 Clinical Event (Append-Only Log)

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `event_id` | UUID (PK) | Unique event identifier |
| `session_id` | UUID (FK → sessions) | Parent session |
| `event_type` | ENUM | One of: `BP_READING`, `MEDICATION_ADDED`, `MEDICATION_STOPPED`, `SYMPTOM_REPORTED`, `DEMOGRAPHIC`, `LAB_RESULT` |
| `payload` | JSONB | Event-specific structured data |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | Event creation time |

**Event Payload Examples:**

```json
// BP_READING
{ "systolic": 145, "diastolic": 92, "context": "morning reading" }

// MEDICATION_ADDED
{ "drug_name": "Amlodipine", "dosage": "5mg", "frequency": "daily" }

// MEDICATION_STOPPED
{ "drug_name": "Lisinopril", "reason": "patient reported cough" }

// DEMOGRAPHIC
{ "age": 58, "sex": "male", "smoking_status": "former" }
```

### 8.3 Context Snapshot (Materialized View)

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `session_id` | UUID (FK → sessions, UNIQUE) | One snapshot per session |
| `snapshot` | JSONB | Accumulated patient context |
| `soft_ask_count` | INTEGER | Number of consecutive SOFT-ASK responses issued |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMP | Last projection time |

**Snapshot JSONB Structure:**

```json
{
  "demographics": { "age": 58, "sex": "male", "smoking": "former" },
  "current_medications": [
    { "drug": "Amlodipine", "dosage": "5mg", "frequency": "daily" }
  ],
  "discontinued_medications": [
    { "drug": "Lisinopril", "reason": "cough", "stopped_at": "..." }
  ],
  "recent_bp_readings": [
    { "systolic": 145, "diastolic": 92, "context": "morning" }
  ],
  "symptoms": ["ankle swelling", "occasional headache"],
  "comorbidities": ["type 2 diabetes"],
  "lab_results": []
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Conflict Resolved (ADL-001):** This snapshot is produced by the **Deterministic State Projector**, not by the LLM. The LLM (Context Extractor) produces typed delta events. The Projector applies business rules (e.g., a `MEDICATION_STOPPED` event removes the drug from `current_medications` and adds it to `discontinued_medications`). This guarantees idempotent replay.

### 8.4 Audit Log

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `audit_id` | UUID (PK) | Unique log entry |
| `session_id` | UUID (FK → sessions) | Parent session |

| **Dense Vector** | name=`dense`, dimensions=384, distance=Cosine, model=`bge-small-en-v1.5` |
| **Sparse Vector** | name=`sparse`, model=`Qdrant/bm25` (via fastembed client-side generation) |

**Payload Schema per Point:**

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `chunk_id` | string | Unique identifier for the chunk |
| `guideline_id` | string | `AHA_ACC_2025`, `ESC_ESH_2024`, or `MEDLINEPLUS` |
| `section_title` | string | Section/subsection header from the source document |
| `page_number` | integer | Source PDF page number |
| `chunk_text` | string | Full text content of the chunk |
| `source_url` | string | URL or document reference for citation |

> [!NOTE]
> **Conflict Resolved (ADL-022):** Qdrant does not compute BM25 sparse vectors server-side. The `fastembed` library with model `Qdrant/bm25` must be used client-side at both ingestion time and query time to produce sparse vectors. This is a mandatory dependency.

## 9. AI Pipeline Description

### 9.1 Pipeline Overview

The AI pipeline consists of **4 LLM inference calls** to a shared reasoning engine, plus **1 deterministic retrieval-reranking stage** and **1 deterministic state projection step**. All LLM calls use a single model endpoint (Groq Llama 3.1 8B or GPT-4o-mini).

```

### 9.2 LLM Call 1 — Context Extractor

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Purpose** | Extract structured medical facts from the raw patient message; produce typed delta events for the event log; generate a reformulated clinical search query |
| **Input** | Raw user message + current context snapshot (JSONB) |
| **Output Schema** | `ExtractorOutput` |
| **Temperature** | 0.0 |

**`ExtractorOutput` Schema:**

```
{
  "delta_events": [
    {
      "event_type": "BP_READING | MEDICATION_ADDED | MEDICATION_STOPPED | SYMPTOM_REPORTED | DEMOGRAPHIC | LAB_RESULT",
      "payload": { ... }
    }
  ],
  "search_query": "reformulated clinical search query string",
  "raw_intent": "brief natural-language summary of what the patient is asking"
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Conflict Resolved (ADL-023):** Query reformulation (`search_query`) was originally assigned to LLM Call 2 (Context Gate). This document moves it to LLM Call 1, as the Extractor already performs structured analysis and can generate the search query as a natural byproduct without overloading the safety-critical Context Gate.

### 9.3 LLM Call 2 — Context Gate (Gate 1, Pre-Retrieval)

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Purpose** | Pure binary classification: determine whether the accumulated context snapshot contains sufficient patient information for safe personalized retrieval |
| **Input** | Context snapshot (JSONB) + raw user message + `raw_intent` from Extractor |
| **Output Schema** | `ContextGateOutput` |
| **Temperature** | 0.0, seed 42 |
| **Decision Rule** | If essential clinical parameters needed for personalization are missing → `SOFT-ASK`. Otherwise → `PROCEED`. |

**`ContextGateOutput` Schema:**

```
{
  "action": "SOFT-ASK | PROCEED",
  "missing_fields": ["age", "current_medications"],
  "rationale": "Patient has not provided age or current medication list, which are required for personalized BP target guidance."
}
```

**State Machine Logic (post-gate):**

| Condition | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| `action == PROCEED` | Continue to Hybrid Retrieval (Stage 4) |
| `action == SOFT-ASK` AND `soft_ask_count < 2` | Short-circuit to Response Generator with SOFT-ASK template; increment `soft_ask_count` |
| `action == SOFT-ASK` AND `soft_ask_count ≥ 2` | Force override to `GENERALIZE`; proceed to Hybrid Retrieval with generic query |

### 9.4 Hybrid Retrieval & Reranking (Stages 4–5)

| Stage | Component | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **4a. Sparse Search** | BM25 via fastembed | Client-side tokenization of `search_query` → sparse vector → Qdrant sparse search |
| **4b. Dense Search** | bge-small-en-v1.5 | Encode `search_query` → 384-dim dense vector → Qdrant dense search |
| **4c. Fusion** | Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) | Merge sparse + dense result sets; produce unified Top-20 ranked candidates |
| **5. Reranking** | Cross-Encoder | Score all 20 query-document pairs; return Top-5 with reranker scores |

**Reranker Model Selection (Resolved — ADL-020):**

The deployment runs on CPU without GPU. Two acceptable options:

| Option | Model | Parameters | CPU Latency (20 pairs) |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **A (Preferred)** | `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` | 22M | ~100–200ms |
| B | `bge-reranker-v2-m3` (ONNX quantized) | 560M | ~500–800ms |

The chosen reranker **must** be offloaded to a background thread via `asyncio.to_thread()` to avoid blocking the FastAPI event loop.

### 9.5 LLM Call 3 — Evidence Gate (Gate 2, Post-Retrieval)

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Purpose** | Evaluate whether the Top-5 retrieved evidence chunks are sufficient to safely answer the patient's query |
| **Input** | Top-5 evidence chunks (text + metadata) + context snapshot + user query |
| **Output Schema** | `EvidenceGateOutput` |
| **Temperature** | 0.0, seed 42 |

**`EvidenceGateOutput` Schema:**

```
{
  "action": "ANSWER | GENERALIZE | ABSTAIN | ESCALATE",
  "evidence_sufficient": true,
  "rationale": "Top-ranked chunks directly address Amlodipine dosing for a 58-year-old male with diabetes per AHA/ACC 2025 Section 8.2."
}
```

**Decision Matrix (Resolved — ADL-024):**

| Action | Trigger Criteria |
| :--- | :--- |
| **ANSWER** | Top-ranked evidence directly addresses the patient's specific clinical parameters (drug, dosage, comorbidity combination) with high semantic relevance |
| **GENERALIZE** | Evidence covers the general disease topic (hypertension management) but lacks specificity for the patient's exact scenario (e.g., no match for their specific drug combination or comorbidity) |
| **ABSTAIN** | Top-ranked evidence has low relevance, or the query falls outside the cardiovascular knowledge base domain (e.g., pediatric dosing, oncology, orthopedics) |
| **ESCALATE** | Query indicates acute clinical danger: symptoms consistent with hypertensive emergency (BP > 180/120 mmHg with end-organ damage), stroke, or acute coronary syndrome, regardless of evidence availability |

### 9.6 LLM Call 4 — Response Generator

| Property | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Purpose** | Synthesize a patient-facing response grounded in retrieved evidence, using XML-isolated prompt structure to prevent fact-evidence contamination |
| **Input** | Action decision + evidence package + context snapshot + user query |
| **Output Schema** | `ResponseGeneratorOutput` |
| **Temperature** | 0.3 (for natural language fluency) |
| **Invoked For** | `ANSWER` and `GENERALIZE` actions **only** |
| **Not Invoked For** | `ABSTAIN` and `ESCALATE` (deterministic templates used instead) |

**XML-Isolated Prompt Structure (Resolved — ADL-025):**

```xml
<system_instructions>
  You are a clinical communication assistant. Generate a response using
  ONLY the evidence provided in <clinical_evidence>. Do not assume or
  infer patient information not present in <patient_context>. Follow
  the routing action: {action_decision}.
  Include inline citation markers [1], [2], etc. for each clinical claim.
</system_instructions>

<patient_context>
  {context_snapshot_json}
</patient_context>

<clinical_evidence>
  <chunk id="1" source="{guideline_id}" section="{section_title}">
    {chunk_text}
  </chunk>
  <!-- up to 5 chunks -->
</clinical_evidence>

<user_query>
  {original_user_message}
</user_query>
```

**`ResponseGeneratorOutput` Schema:**

```
{
  "response_text": "Based on current guidelines, ... [1]. Your Amlodipine dosage ... [2].",
  "citations": [
    { "marker": "[1]", "chunk_id": "aha_2025_s8_c3", "source": "AHA/ACC 2025", "section": "Section 8.2", "excerpt": "..." },
    { "marker": "[2]", "chunk_id": "aha_2025_s8_c7", "source": "AHA/ACC 2025", "section": "Section 8.5", "excerpt": "..." }
  ]
}
```

### 9.7 LLM Inference Configuration

| Parameter | LLM Calls 1–3 (Extraction & Gates) | LLM Call 4 (Generation) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `temperature` | 0.0 | 0.3 |
| `top_p` | 1.0 | 0.95 |
| `seed` | 42 (where supported) | — |
| `max_tokens` | 512 | 1024 |
| `response_format` | JSON mode / structured output | JSON mode / structured output |

> [!NOTE]
> **Gap Resolved (ADL-026):** No original artifact specified these parameters. They are now mandatory configuration for the orchestrator pipeline.

### 9.8 Resilient LLM Wrapper

All 4 LLM calls are wrapped in a resilience layer:

```
Attempt 1 → Parse JSON → Validate Pydantic schema → Success
         ↓ (parse failure)
    JSON repair (fix trailing commas, unclosed brackets)
Attempt 2 → Parse JSON → Validate Pydantic schema → Success
         ↓ (parse failure)
    Re-prompt with explicit schema reminder
Attempt 3 → Parse JSON → Validate Pydantic schema → Success
         ↓ (permanent failure)
    Deterministic fallback → GENERALIZE (Calls 1–3) or ESCALATE (Call 4)
    Log failure to audit trail → Never return HTTP 500 to patient
```

## 10. Storage Architecture

### 10.1 PostgreSQL (Relational + Event Store)

| Concern | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pattern** | Event Sourcing with materialized JSONB snapshot |
| **Tables** | `sessions`, `clinical_events`, `context_snapshots`, `audit_logs` |
| **Write Model** | Append-only to `clinical_events`; upsert to `context_snapshots` |
| **Read Model** | `context_snapshots` (single row per session, token-efficient for LLM prompts) |
| **Projection** | Deterministic State Projector folds event stream → snapshot (not the LLM) |
| **ORM** | SQLAlchemy 2.0 + asyncpg (async driver) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Conflict Resolved (ADL-005):** The requirements document stated PostgreSQL does not need a Docker container. The deployment diagram shows it containerized. This document standardizes on **Docker Compose** managing both PostgreSQL (:5432) and Qdrant (:6333) containers, which provides environment isolation and reproducible setup.

### 10.2 Qdrant (Vector Store)

| Concern | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pattern** | Hybrid dense + sparse vector search with RRF fusion |
| **Collection** | `clinical_guidelines` |
| **Dense Model** | `bge-small-en-v1.5` (384 dimensions, Cosine distance) |
| **Sparse Model** | `Qdrant/bm25` via `fastembed` (client-side tokenization) |
| **Ingestion** | One-time offline batch via `IngestionWorker` CLI |
| **Query-Time** | Hybrid search returning Top-20 candidates with payload metadata |

### 11.2 Service Configuration

| Service | Runtime | Port | Container | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| Streamlit Frontend | Python (Tornado) | 8501 | No | `streamlit run app.py` |
| FastAPI Backend | Python 3.11 / Uvicorn | 8000 | No | `uvicorn main:app --port 8000` |
| PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL 16 | 5432 | **Yes** (Docker) | Bound to `127.0.0.1:5432` |
| Qdrant | Qdrant latest | 6333 | **Yes** (Docker) | Bound to `127.0.0.1:6333` |
| Groq Cloud API | External SaaS | 443 | N/A | HTTPS, requires `GROQ_API_KEY` |

### 11.3 Docker Compose Specification

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml (authoritative)
version: "3.9"
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:5432:5432"           # Loopback only (ADL-019)

```

### 11.4 Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Yes | API key for Groq Cloud LLM inference |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Conditional | API key for GPT-4o-mini (if used as fallback) |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Yes | PostgreSQL password (not hardcoded in compose) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | `postgresql+asyncpg://medbridge_app:{password}@127.0.0.1:5432/medbridge` |
| `QDRANT_URL` | Yes | `http://127.0.0.1:6333` |
| `LLM_MODEL` | Yes | Model identifier (e.g., `llama-3.1-8b-instant` or `gpt-4o-mini`) |

### 11.5 Local Compute Requirements

| Resource | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **GPU** | Not required. All LLM inference is offloaded to Groq Cloud API |
| **CPU** | BGE embedding model (~33M params) and cross-encoder reranker run locally on CPU |
| **RAM** | ≥ 8 GB (PostgreSQL + Qdrant + Python process + embedding models) |
| **Disk** | ≥ 5 GB (Docker images + Qdrant vectors + PostgreSQL data) |

> [!NOTE]
> **Conflict Resolved (ADL-021):** The deployment diagram labels the frontend-to-backend connection as "HTTPS". For local development on localhost, this document standardizes on plain **HTTP** (`http://localhost:8000`). TLS termination via a reverse proxy is a production concern only.

---

## 12. Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Impact If Wrong |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ASM-01** | No user authentication is required. Sessions are identified by UUID only. Any user with the session ID can access the conversation. | Security vulnerability in any non-academic deployment |
| **ASM-02** | The Groq Cloud API free tier provides sufficient rate limits for development and evaluation (~30 RPM for Llama 3.1 8B). | Pipeline will be throttled; may need to switch to paid tier or OpenAI |
| **ASM-03** | A single instance of Llama 3.1 8B (instruction-tuned) can reliably perform all 4 pipeline tasks (extraction, gate classification, evidence evaluation, response generation) via prompt engineering alone, without fine-tuning. | Gate accuracy will be insufficient; may need task-specific models or few-shot examples |
| **ASM-04** | Three clinical guideline sources (AHA/ACC 2025, ESC/ESH 2024, MedlinePlus) provide sufficient coverage for adult hypertension queries in the evaluation benchmark. | Out-of-domain queries will trigger excessive ABSTAIN rates |
| **ASM-05** | The fastembed library supports client-side BM25 sparse vector generation compatible with Qdrant's named sparse vector format. | Hybrid search degrades to dense-only retrieval |
| **ASM-06** | PostgreSQL and Qdrant Docker containers can run simultaneously on a typical developer laptop (8+ GB RAM) without resource contention. | Memory pressure causes OOM kills or container restarts |
| **ASM-07** | Patient inputs are in English and relate to adult hypertension management. The system does not handle pediatric, pregnancy-related, or non-cardiovascular queries. | Increased ABSTAIN/ESCALATE rates for off-topic queries |
| **ASM-08** | The `soft_ask_count` threshold of 2 is a reasonable limit before falling back to `GENERALIZE`. This number may need tuning based on user study results. | Patients may be frustrated if asked too many questions, or context may be insufficient if too few |
| **ASM-09** | The Deterministic State Projector can handle all event types with simple merge/overwrite rules without requiring a complex CRDT or conflict resolution system. | Edge cases in conflicting events (e.g., contradictory BP readings) may produce incorrect snapshots |
| **ASM-10** | The cross-encoder reranker can run within acceptable latency (< 1.5s) on CPU when limited to 20 candidate pairs using a lightweight model (ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2). | End-to-end latency exceeds 8-second target |

---

## 13. Constraints

| ID | Constraint | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CON-01** | **Academic semester timeline.** The system must be implementable, deployable, and evaluable within a single university semester. | Project scope |
| **CON-02** | **Zero local GPU.** No local GPU is available. All heavy LLM inference must use cloud APIs (Groq / OpenAI). Local CPU handles only embedding and reranking. | Deployment diagram |
| **CON-03** | **Single-node deployment.** No Kubernetes, no multi-node orchestration. All services run on one machine via Docker Compose + local Python processes. | Deployment diagram |
| **CON-04** | **External LLM dependency.** The system critically depends on Groq or OpenAI API availability. A cloud outage disables the entire AI pipeline. | Architecture |
| **CON-05** | **Clinical guideline currency.** The knowledge base is a static snapshot of AHA/ACC 2025 and ESC/ESH 2024 guidelines. It does not auto-update when new guidelines are published. | Knowledge sources |
| **CON-06** | **No fine-tuning.** The LLM is used via prompt engineering and structured output only. No model weights are modified. | Spec |
| **CON-07** | **Python-only backend.** The entire backend and AI pipeline must be implemented in Python 3.11+. No polyglot services. | Tech stack |
| **CON-08** | **RAG framework: Raw SDK.** The retrieval pipeline uses direct `qdrant-client` + `fastembed` + `sentence-transformers` SDK calls, not a higher-level framework like LlamaIndex. | ADL-006 resolution |

> [!NOTE]
> **Conflict Resolved (ADL-006):** The requirements document mentioned LlamaIndex, but all diagrams show custom retrieval components. This document standardizes on the **raw SDK approach** (`qdrant-client` + `fastembed` + `sentence-transformers`) as the diagrams represent the actual intended architecture.

## 14. Risks

### 14.1 Risk Register

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Severity | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **RSK-01** | **Groq API rate limiting or outage** halts all LLM inference, rendering the system non-functional | Medium | Critical | 🔴 | Implement provider failover (Groq → OpenAI). Configure retry with exponential backoff. Cache deterministic gate responses for repeated identical queries. |
| **RSK-02** | **LLM structured output failures** — Llama 3.1 8B produces malformed JSON that cannot be parsed after retries | High | High | 🟠 | Resilient LLM Wrapper with 3-attempt retry, JSON repair, and deterministic fallback to GENERALIZE/ESCALATE (never HTTP 500). |
| **RSK-03** | **PHI/PII leakage to cloud providers** — patient health data transmitted to Groq/OpenAI without anonymization | High | Critical | 🔴 | Documented as an architectural gap (ADL-017). Mitigation: add PII scrubbing layer in a future phase. For the semester, use synthetic test data only and document the limitation. |
| **RSK-04** | **Prompt injection attacks** — adversarial patient inputs manipulate gate classifications, overriding safety routing | Medium | Critical | 🔴 | Implement XML-delimited prompt structure separating system instructions from untrusted user input. Add input sanitization heuristics. Document as a known attack surface. |
| **RSK-05** | **Gate classification accuracy** — Context Gate or Evidence Gate misclassifies, leading to unsafe ANSWER when ABSTAIN/ESCALATE was correct | Medium | Critical | 🔴 | Validate via MedBridge-AQ benchmark (200+ vignettes). Ablation studies comparing gate presence vs. absence. Conservative gate thresholds (prefer false-positive SOFT-ASK over false-negative PROCEED). |
| **RSK-06** | **Cross-encoder CPU latency** exceeds acceptable limits, causing end-to-end response time > 8 seconds | Medium | Medium | 🟡 | Use lightweight reranker (ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2, 22M params). Offload to background thread. Benchmark during development to validate. |
| **RSK-07** | **Knowledge base coverage gaps** — patient asks about a drug or condition not covered by AHA/ACC/ESC/MedlinePlus | High | Medium | 🟡 | Evidence Gate routes to ABSTAIN or GENERALIZE. Add MedlinePlus as a broader fallback source. Document the domain boundary clearly in the UI. |
| **RSK-08** | **Event Sourcing snapshot drift** — if the Deterministic State Projector has bugs, the snapshot diverges from the event log, causing incorrect context for all downstream gates | Low | High | 🟠 | Unit test all projection rules exhaustively. Implement a snapshot reconstruction validator that replays the event log and compares against the stored snapshot. |
| **RSK-09** | **Evaluation benchmark bias** — MedBridge-AQ vignettes do not adequately represent real patient query distributions | Medium | High | 🟠 | Target Cohen's κ ≥ 0.6. Include adversarial examples (RABBITS). Compare against multiple baselines. Document limitations in the evaluation chapter. |
| **RSK-10** | **Single-point-of-failure deployment** — all services on one node; any service crash (PostgreSQL, Qdrant, Uvicorn) takes down the entire system | High | Medium | 🟡 | Acceptable for semester scope. Document as a production gap. Docker Compose restart policies (`restart: unless-stopped`) provide basic resilience. |

### 14.2 Unmitigated Architectural Gaps (Acknowledged)

The following items from the ADL are acknowledged as gaps that will **not** be fully resolved in the semester implementation. They are documented here for transparency and future work.

| ADL | Gap | Semester Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ADL-017 | PII Anonymization Layer | Deferred. Use synthetic data for evaluation. Document as limitation. |
| ADL-018 | Prompt Injection Defense | Partially mitigated via XML isolation in prompt structure. Full adversarial testing deferred. |
| ADL-019 | Database Authentication & Network Binding | Mitigated by binding to `127.0.0.1` in Docker Compose. Full auth configuration documented but not enforced. |
